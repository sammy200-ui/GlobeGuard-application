# Scam Awareness App ‚Äì Firebase Integration

This project uses **Firebase** as a backend-as-a-service for authentication, database, and optional storage.  
Since this project focuses mainly on frontend (React Native + Expo), Firebase eliminates the need for a custom backend while still providing full functionality.

## üîπ Firebase Services Used

### 1. Authentication (Firebase Auth)
- Handles **Login / Signup** flows.  
- Supports email/password login.  
- Stores secure user sessions.  

### 2. Database (Cloud Firestore)
- Stores **scam reports** and **user data**.  
- Example collections:
```plaintext
users/
  userId/
    email: "user@example.com"
    savedScams: [scamId1, scamId2]

scams/
  scamId1/
    title: "Fake Taxi Scam"
    type: "Travel"
    location: "Bangkok, Thailand"
    description: "Tourists are overcharged for short rides."
